    MS-DOS window that appears.

Note: Sometimes after clicking on install.bat a MS-DOS window 
appears for a very short time and then disappears. If that is 
the case, then some error has caused it. To see what the error 
was and to correct the problem, first open MS-DOS Command Prompt 
window yourself. In that window change the directory to the one that HEG 
install.bat is. Type install.bat and push Enter. You may now see 
what the error is and take appropriate action to correct the problem. 

Also if you succeed in installing HEG and creating HEGTool.bat you 
may get error during opening HEGTool.bat. If after clicking on HEGTool.bat
the MS-DOS window appears for a very short time and then disappears, then
you are having some kind of error in HEGTool.bat. To see what the error 
is and to correct it do the following:
1. Open MS-DOS Command Prompt window yourself. In that window change
 the directory to the one that HEG's bin directory is.
2. Type HEGTool.bat and press Return. You will get an error. Correct the 
problem (Which more likely is a path problem) and continue.
