# Image Downloader Project

## Introduction
This script is developed for the Polar Continental Shelf Program (PCSP) under Natural Resources Canada. It automates the downloading and processing of satellite imagery for a designated area of interest KML file, facilitating the logistical coordination of the PCSP's activities. The Imagery is taken from MODIS AQUA using LANCE and results in a KMZ around your area of interest for use in Google Earth or other software. The batch file is set up to run through the python script once, for continual use we recomend using Task Scheduler for Windows systems or any other equivalent software. For ease of utlility we recommend that you set up your folder in a similar configuration that we have set up the GitHub repository. It will be easier to keep all the config, python, environment, area of interest kml, batch and metadata file in the main Image Downloader Project folder. The HDF, GEOTIFF_Bands, TIFF_Final and KMZ are each specific outputs created while running the script. They are kept seperate for organizational benefit and help with the debugging process if errors appear. If this file structure does not work to your benefit feel free to change folder names or paths which you can easily do in the configuration file. You will find an example KML (cambridge.kml) file in the GitHub repository as well as a coresponding KMZ in the KMZ folder.
